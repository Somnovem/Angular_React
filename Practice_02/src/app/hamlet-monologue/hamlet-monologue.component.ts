  "<b id=\"monologue-start\">To be, or not to be</b>, that is the        question: <br/>\n" +
  "    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer <br/>\n" +
  "    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, <br/>\n" +
  "    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles <br/>\n" +
  "    And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep, <br/>\n" +
  "    No more; and by a sleep to say we end <br/>\n" +
  "    The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks <br/>\n" +
  "    That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation <br/>\n" +
  "    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; <br/>\n" +
  "    To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub: <br/>\n" +
  "    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, <br/>\n" +
  "    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, <br/>\n" +
  "    Must give us pause—there's the respect <br/>\n" +
  "    That makes calamity of so long life. <br/>\n" +
  "    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, <br/>\n" +
  "    Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, <br/>\n" +
  "    The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay, <br/>\n" +
  "    The insolence of office, and the spurns <br/>\n" +
  "    That patient merit of th'unworthy takes, <br/>\n" +
  "    When he himself might his quietus make <br/>\n" +
  "    With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, <br/>\n" +
  "    To grunt and sweat under a weary life, <br/>\n" +
  "    But that the dread of something after death, <br/>\n" +
  "    The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn <br/>\n" +
  "    No traveller returns, puzzles the will, <br/>\n" +
  "    And makes us rather bear those ills we have <br/>\n" +
  "    Than fly to others that we know not of? <br/>\n" +
  "    Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all, <br/>\n" +
  "    And thus the native hue of resolution <br/>\n" +
  "    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, <br/>\n" +
  "    And enterprises of great pith and moment <br/>\n" +
  "    With this regard their currents turn awry <br/>\n" +
  "    And lose the name of action." ;
