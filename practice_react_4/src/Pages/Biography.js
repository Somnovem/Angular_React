            <h1>Sandro Botticelli</h1>
            <h3>Lived in: <b>1445-1510</b></h3>
            <p>Sandro Botticelli, whose full name was Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi, was a renowned Italian Renaissance painter born around 1445 in Florence, Italy.
               He is celebrated for his exquisite contributions to the world of art, and his work remains highly influential to this day.</p>
            <p>Despite his remarkable talent and the enduring popularity of his works, Botticelli's career took a turn as he aligned himself with the fiery Dominican
               friar Girolamo Savonarola. Under Savonarola's influence, Botticelli destroyed some of his own paintings, particularly those considered too secular or pagan.
               This period marked a decline in his artistic output.</p>
            <p>Sandro Botticelli's legacy endures, and his artistic contributions have left an indelible mark on the history of art. His ability to capture the
               ideals of beauty and grace of the Renaissance period continues to captivate art lovers and scholars alike, ensuring his place as one of the great
               masters of the Italian Renaissance.</p>
